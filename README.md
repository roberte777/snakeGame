This is a passion project and an exploration into machine learning. I have not yet designed a good looking front end for this application.

Essentially, there are two parts to this project. One is a simple snake game that users can play. 
The second is the machine learning. I designed an AI that learns to play snake using reinforcement learning. This process was really fun, and it is neat to see the AI learn as it plays. After each game, it assesses the moves it took during that game and assigns them reward values.



## Getting Started

First, install node modules

Type the following in the project directory:

```
npm install
```

Second, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
